Here are some apps I've built, you can find the code in my pinned repositories

[Esque](https://esque.click) A teams project management app with role based permissions, kanban and list views, pagination, and undo/redo functionality.

[Learn the Notes](https://learnthenotes.netlify.app/) - an interactive guitar app for learning the notes on the fretboard. It has sections on triads and scales for further learning.

[ChordBuilder](https://chordbuilder.netlify.app/) - a chord sheet building app I built for guitar players and educators. (Bass players can use it too!)

[Tremendo](https://tremendo.pro) - a project management and team collaboration tool. You can create an account, organize your projects in Kanban boards, and invite other users to colloborate on them.
