Here are some apps I've built, you can find the code in my pinned repositories

[Tremendo](https://tremendo.pro) - a project management and team collaboration tool. You can create an account and organize your projects in Kanban boards.

[ChordBuilder](https://chordbuilder.netlify.app/) - a chord sheet building app I built for guitar players and educators. (Bass players can use it too!)

[Notionesque](https://notionesque.netlify.app/) - another task manager with list and kanban views. This one saves your info to local storage so an account isn't needed.
